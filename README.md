This project represents my graduate work, which was created in 2020 while studying at a private educational collage in the city of Grodno.

The main idea of the project was to create a decentralized program for transferring (to one or a group of nodes) messages and files encrypted using the RSA encryption algorithm.

The connection between the nodes was created using the built-in "socket" library.
